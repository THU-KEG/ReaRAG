      "\n",
      "- **1998**: PolyGram's parent company, Seagram, which controlled Universal Pictures, began considering divesting in PFE. This led to a series of transactions that would reshape the ownership of PolyGram's assets, including its film library.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **1998**: Seagram decided to sell the bulk of its film library, which included films released up until March 31, 1996, to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). This sale did not include \"The Game,\" as it was released after this date.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **1998**: The remaining film assets of PolyGram, including those released after March 31, 1996, were folded into Universal Pictures. This meant that Universal Pictures, through its association with PolyGram Entertainment, became the owner of \"The Game\" (1997) after this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while PolyGram Filmed Entertainment was the producer of \"The Game\" (1997) during its production and release, the company's ownership of the film transitioned to Universal Pictures in 1998 as a result of the sale and restructuring.\u001b[0m\n",
